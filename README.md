# Machine-Learning-Project-02

# Diabetics Prediction 
This project is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. It leverages patient health data such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and other relevant metrics to make accurate predictions. The goal of the project is to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early detection and management of diabetes.

# Dataset
The project uses a publicly available diabetes dataset, such as the Diabetes Dataset from the Kaggle. The dataset contains medical records of patients along with a label indicating diabetes presence.

# Features
+ Data Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes the input dataset for optimal model performance.
+ Machine Learning Models: Implements popular algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
+ Model Evaluation: Includes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
+ User-Friendly Interface: A simple interface for inputting patient data and viewing predictions (if applicable).
+ Visualization: Provides graphical representations of data trends and model performance.

# Technologies Used
+ Programming Language: Python
+ Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, Flask (for web interface)
+ Tools: Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization
